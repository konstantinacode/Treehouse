  <h1>My Coding Story</h1>
	<h2>By Konstantina Matthaiou</h2>
  
 <p> I am not really sure who code got into my life. I always remember myself enjoying messing around with technonogy.</p>
   
  <p> When I was really young, my mother took a computer to teach herself how to use one. At the time computers wasn't something that you could find in any house, at least in Greece where I grew up. I loved it when she let me use it. You couldn't do many things with it but I wanted to be there and play around with it as much as I could.</p>
    
  <p> Growing up I always wanted to have all these "silly" things, a gameboy, an electonic organizer, although it was completely useless for someone in my age. How cool it must be to be the one who made this magic device or the one who wrote the software that some other uses!</p>
      
  <p> Moving along a lot of years after all these, I met someone at my work who worked as a developer, I like to call him as my mentor. I started watching tons of youTube videos about programming. Beginning might seem easy but after a while I felt frustrated and I had no idea if I would ever be good at it.</p>
  
  <p> There are some points in my life that were really important for me. The first was at June 21, 2016 when I enrolled the free code camp community. I learned some many things about front-end, but after some months I start feeling frustrated once again although I didn't stop. </p>
  
  <p> Next stop in my journey was an incredible six-months programmer school I took through my job. Here I learned some basics about java, dot net, databases, data structure and much more. After these six months I knew that I wanted to be a programmer.</p>
  
  <p> In my country you have to have some level of computer science degree to be considered as a programmer, that's why I gave exams and got in the University. Studying in university gives you more theoretical knowledge and I wanted to work my existing ones, the more practical ones too. That's how I end up trying <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/home">Treehouse</a>.</p>
